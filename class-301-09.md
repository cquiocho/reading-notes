## Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript

**Functional programming is a pradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs.**

### Pure Functions

- It returns the same result given the same arugments (deterministic).
- It does not cause any observable side effects.  

**Examples of a not pure function:**

- Use of a global object as a parameter.
- If it reads external files, file contents can change. 
- Random number generation.

*Pure functions are stable, consistent and predictable.*

### Immutable Data

- Data that cannot be changed after it's created.
- You must create a new object with the new value. 

**Pure Functions + Immutable Data = Referential Transparency**

- If a function consistently yields the same result for the same input.

### Functions as First-Class Entities

- Refer to it from constants and variables.
- Pass it as a parameter to other functions.
- Return it as result from other functions.

*Treat functions as values and pass functions like data, we can combine different functions to create new functions with new behavior.*

### Higher-Order Functions

- Takes one or more functions as arguments.
- Returns a function as its result. 

> Filter - Expects a true or false value to determine if the element should or should not be included. 


> Map - Transforms a collection by applying a function to all of its elements and builds a new one from the retuned values.


> Reduce - Receive a function and a collection, return a calue created by combining the items.


## Refactoring Javascript for Performance and Readability

**Strategies:**

1. Return early from functions.
1. Cache variables so functions can be read like sentences.
1. Check for Web APIs before implementing your own funcitonality.
