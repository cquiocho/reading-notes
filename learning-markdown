# I embrace the ***Growth Mindset***.   

## I welcome the opportunity to try new things, encountering new challenges and pursuing new goals. It is how I choose to continue to grow professionally and personally, and how I can proceed forward confidently. This is what brought me here to Code Fellows and why I will succeed at becoming a Software Developer.     
     
         
# **Throughout my journey, I will remind myself that:**     

### - *Failure is eminent, but I will not quit.*
### - *The success of others will inspire and motivate me.*
### - *I will learn from all obstacles encountered and all criticism received.*
