## HTML – Hypertext Markup Language

- HTML pages are electronic text documents
- Provides content, structure and organization of a website. 
- HTML code is comprised of elements and attributes
- An element consists of two tags (opening & closing tags)
- Attributes provide additional information and are made up of an attribute name and an attribute value.

> Need to know what tags are available for use, what they do and where they go

### Common HTML Elements

- `<body></body>` Everything within this element is shown in the browser window.
- `<html></html>` Doctype declaration.
- `<footer></footer>`
- `<head></head>` Contains information about the page, particularly a `<title></title>` and other metadata not shown in the browser window.
- `<h1></h1>` Use of headings and subheadings reflect hierarchy of information.
- `<p></p> ` Paragraph

### Evolution of HTML & Extra Markup

1. HTML 4 - released in 1997
1. XHTML 1.0 - released om 2000
1. HTML5 - released in 2014

> Each new version was designed to be an improvement on the last, new elements and attributes added and older code removed. 

> Add comment in HTML code: `<!-- comments goes here -->`

- ID Attribute - **id=** Used to uniquely identify a *particular* element from other elements on the page.  
- Class Attribute - **class=** A way to identify *several* elements as being different from the other elements on the page.
- Block Elements - `<h1>, <p>, <ul>, <li>` Elements that will appear to start on a new line in the browser window. 
- Inline Elements - `<a>, <b>, <em>, <img>` Elements that will appear to continue on the same line as neighboring elements.
- `<div></div>` Groups text and elements in a block.
- `<span></span>` Groups text and elements inline, an inline equivalent to `<div>`.
- `<iframe></iframe>` Inline frame used to embed content on a page
    1. src - Attribute to specify URL page.
    1. height - Specifies height in pixels.
    1. width - Specifies width in pixels.
- `<meta>` - Element inside the head and contains web page information.
    1. description - Commonly used by search engines to understand a page.
    1. keywords - List of comma-separated words that a user might search.
    1. robots - Indicates whether search engines should add page to search results.

### HTML5

**Introduced a new set of elements that allow you to divide parts of a page.**

**These elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a page and help to describe its structure.**

- `<header> & <footer>` - Elements used for main header/footer or for an specific `<article>` or `<section>`.
- `<nav>` - Element used to contain the major navigation blocks on a a site.
- `<article>` - Acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially syndicated.
- `<aside>` - Two purposes depending on whether it is inside or outside of an `<articel>`. When inside it should contain relevant information to the article, if outside, content is related to the entire page. 
- `<section>` - Groups related content together, typically each section would have its own heading.
- `<hgroups>` - Purpose is to group together a set of heading elements to appear as one single heading.
- `<figure>` & `<figcaption>` - Content must be relevant to the element.
    1. Images
    1. Videos
    1. Graphs
    1. Diagrams
    1. Code Samples
    1. Text that supports the main body of an article.
- `<div>` - An important way to group together related elements.
- `<a>` - This element can be placed around a block element that contains child elements. Allows you to turn an entire block into a link.

## HTML Process & Design

### WHO:
Websites should be designed for the target audience, research is highly recommended to pinpoint the exact demographic in order to design accordingly.
Knowing your target audience will influence design decisions, from color palettes to level of detail.

### WHY:
- Why is your audience visiting your site?
- Determine the motivations (personal v. professional, essential v. luxury, etc.) and goals (general information, news & updates, help with a product or service, etc.) for the website.

### WHAT:
- What information needs to be provided to achieve goals quickly and effectively? 
- Provide important information on what makes this product/service different from others and/or more appealing.
- Focus on the goals that your visitors want to achieve.

#### “How often will the information need to be udpdate?”

### Create a Site Map

**Site Map – a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site.**

### Card Sorting - Information, Groups, Pages

### Wireframe – sketch of the key information and content that each page will need to show hierarchy and space needed. 

- Sketch or shade areas where each element of the page will go.
- Logo, primary navigation, headings and main bodies of text, etc.

### Content to communicate what? Prioritize and Organize

- Prioritize with Visual Hierarchy
- Visual Hierarchy – helps users focus on key images or messages to draw attention and guide them accordingly. Size, Color & Style.

- Organize with Grouping & Similarity to help simplify the information presented.
- Grouping – helps to identify related content and provides simplicity. Proximity, Closure & Continuance.
- Similarity – helps to associate particular type of content. White Space, Color & Borders.

**Navigation should be concise, clear and selective. It should also provide context, be interactive and remain consistent.**

## Javascript

### Provides dynamic functionality to interact with web page.
### This is where we change how the web page behaves.

Javascript runs where a html **script** element is found.
- a script is used to provide a series of instructions to be followed one-by-one.
- each individual step is called a **statement**.

**JAVASCRIPT IS CASE SENSITIVE.**

**WRITE COMMENTS TO EXPLAIN WHAT EACH CODE WILL DO.**

- Multiple Line Comments = "/* */"
- Single Line Comments = "//"

**Variables** - stored bits of information to perform a desired result.
**Declare** - once a variable is declared = assign a value to it 

Javascript distinguishes between *numeric*, *string* and *boolean* data types.
- Numeric Data Types - Numbers.
- String Data Types - Consists of letters and other characters.
- Boolean Data Types - True or False.
