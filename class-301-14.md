## Database Normalization

- Process used to organize a database into tables and columns.
- Main idea with this is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics.

**Limit a table to one purpose and is limits the number of duplicate data contained in a database.**

### Reasons for Database Normalization

1. Minimize duplicate data. Duplicate information:
    - Increases storage and decreases performance.
    - More difficult to maintain data changes.
1. Minimize and avoid data modification issues. Three types of modification anomalies:
    - Insert Anomaly - Facts cannot be recorded unless all infmormation is provided for the entire row.
    - Update Anomaly - Inconsistencies appear if all rows are not updated.
    - Deletion Anomaly - Deletion of a row causes a removal of more than one set of facts.
1. Simplify queries. Searching and sorting data.

### Definitions of Database Normalization

**Progressive and rely on the rules of the previous forms.**

- **First Normal Form** – The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.

- **Second Normal Form** – The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.

- **Third Normal Form** – the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key
