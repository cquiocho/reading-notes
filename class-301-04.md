## CSS Grids

### X-Axis (Horizontal Axis)

- **grid-column-start** - Based on the vertical border from the left.
    - Negative numbers can also be utilized.

- **grid-column-end** - Determined by the vertical border from left. 
    - This can be used from the right border counting backwards in conjunction with grid-column-start.
    - Negative numbers can also be utilized in conjunction with grid-column-start.

- **grid-column** - Shorthand property that is able to accept both grid-column-start and grid-column-end values at once, separated by a slash.

> `grid-column: 2 / 4;`

*will set item to start on the 2nd vertical line and end on the 4th.

> `grid-column: 2/ span 3;`

*will set item to start on the 2nd vertical line and span 3 columns.

## Y-Axis (Vertical Axis)

- **grid-row-start** - Works much like grid-column-start except along vertical axis.

- **grid-row-end** - Works much like grid-column-end except along vertical axis.

- **grid-row** - Shorthand property that works much like grid-column except along vertical axis.

### More Grid Properties

*Use **grid-column** and **grid-row** simultaneously to set position in both dimensions.
  - Use together to span larger areas.

- **span** - Used to define start and end positions based on desired column width. 
    - Only works with positive values.
    - Used in conjunction with grid-column-start and end.
    - Used to set items width relative to end position.

- **grid-area** - Shorthand that accepts four values separated by slashes: grid-row-start / grid-column-start / grid-row-end / grid-column-end.
  - Overlapping is allowed.

- **order** - All grid items have an order of zero, this can be set to a positive/negative number to override the default position. 

### Grid Templates

- **grid-template-columns** - Five values for five columns.

> `grid-template-columns: 20% 20% 20% 20% 20%;`

- **grid-template-rows** - Five values for five rows.

> `grid-template-rows: 20% 20% 20% 20% 20%;`

- **repeat** - Can be used to simplify grid templates.

> `grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 20%);`
> `grid-template-rows: repeat(5, 20%);`

**Accepts percentages, pixels and ems.**

- **fr** - Fractional unite that allocates one share of the available space. 

> `grid-template-columns: 1fr 5fr`

*Space divided into 6 equal shares. first element 1/6 and second element 5/6.*
