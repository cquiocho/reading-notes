## jQuery

- **A JavaScript library that can be added via script tag to an HTML document.**
- **jQuery script tag should be placed before the closing body tag.**
- The **$** is used to access jQuery to selct HTML elements and perform specific actions on them. The basic sytax is:

> `$("selector").action()`

- The **selector** finds HTML elements.
- The **action()** is performed on the elements.
- jQuery uses CSS sytax to select elements.

### Manipulating Attributes

- `attr()` method is used to **get/set** the value of an attribute.
  > `var val = $("a").attr("href", http://www.jquery.com);`

- `removeAttr()` method is used to remove any attribute of an element.
  > `$("table").removeAttr("border");`

- `html()` method is used to get/change the content of a selected element including the markup tags.
  > `var val = $("p").html();`

- `text()` method is usded to get/change only the text content without HTML markup tags. 
  > `$(#test).text("hello");`

- `val()` sets or returns the value of form fields.
  > `alert($("#name").val());`  

### Manipulating CSS

- `addClass()` method adds one or more classes to selected elements.
  > `$("div").addClass("class1 class2 class3);`

- `removeClass()` method removes one or more class names from selected elements.
  > `$("div").removeClass("red");`

- `toggleClass()` method will remove a class if it exists for an element or will add a class if it does not exist.  

- `css()` method can be used to get/set CSS property values.
  > `$("p").css({"color": "red", "font-size": "200%"});`

- `width() and height()` methods get/set both properties of HTML elements.

### Manipulating the DOM

**Traversing the DOM:**
> parent() - direct parent of the selected element.
> parents() - all ancestor elements of the selected element.
> children() - all direct chldren of the selected element.
> siblings() - all sibling elements.
> eq() - element with a sepcific assigned index number.

  - `var e = $("p").parent();`

- `remove()` method will remove selected elements from the DOM.
   > `$("p").eq(1).remove();`

### Other jQuery Capabilities:

- Handling Events
- Creating Effects
- Using Animations

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

### What is Pair Programming?

**A common technique that utilizes several software engineering practices that dramatically improve the quality of code developers produce. These include:**
  - Iterative Loops
  - Code Reviews
  - Fast Feedback
  - Error Checking
  - Linting

### How does it work?

**Commonly involves two roles:**
  
  - *Driver* - The programmer who is typing and handling the mechanics of coding, managing the text editor, switching files, version control and writing code.
  
  - *Navigator* - Guides the driver but does not write code. They foresee what comes next, how to convert an algorithm into code, scans for typos and bugs and utilizes their computer to look up solutions and documentation.

### Why?

**Pair programming utilizes four fundamental skills needed to lean a new language:**

1. Listening - Hearing and interpreting vocabulary.
1. Speaking - Using the words to communicate an idea.
1. Reading - Understanding the written language.
1. Writing - Producing the written language.

### 6 Reasons

1. Greater Efficiency:
    - Produces higher-quality code that doesn't require very much troubleshooting and debugging.
    - Find and create solutions faster.
    - Enhances technical skills.
    - Improves team communication.
    - Increases enjoyability in the workplace.

1. Engaged Collaboration:
    - Coding is more engaging.
    - Programmers are more focused.
    - Difficult to procrastinate working as a team.
    - Help is readily available by relying on each other.
    - Boosts overall confidence.

1. Learning from Fellow Students:
    - Different approaches to problem solving.
    - Exposure to different skill sets.
    - Helps to solidify understanding.

1. Social Skills:
    - Improves communication.
    - Improves interpersonal skills.

1. Job Interview Readiness:
    - A common step in interview processes involves pair programming.
    - Improves ability to work with and learn from others.

1. Work Environment Readiness:
    - Familiarity with pair programming.
