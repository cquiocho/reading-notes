# Computer Architecture & Logic

## How do Computers work?

### Computers use Binary Information 

- Bit - A single, basic unit of binary information.
- Binary Number System - Consists of the number 0 and 1. 
- Wires - Transport binary information.
     - *more wires equates to more information.*
- Circuits - Process and modify binary information.
     - *the smaller the circuit the faster the information is processed.*

### Computers manipulate Binary Information

1. Input - Takes physical information and converts it into binary information.
1. Store - Binary information is sent to memory.
1. Process - Binary information in memory is processed by the CPU.
1. Output - Binary Infromation is converted into physical information.

### Software

- **Software** tells the CPU what to do with the information.
- **Operating Software** is the master program that manages how software is used.

### Software Developers can define a problem and code information to solve it.
