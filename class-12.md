## Basic Usage of Canvas

**`<canvas>` looks like an image element without *src* or *alt* attributes.**

`<canvas>` has only **two** attributes that are optional (default 300px x 150px):

- width
- height 

*Both attributes can be set up using DOM properties.*

> The `<canvas>` element can be styled like any normal image.

To display something on `<canvas>`, a **script** is required:

## Drawing Shapes with Canvas

`<canvas>` only supports **two** primitive shapes:

1. Rectangles
1. Paths - lists of points connected by lines.

- All other shapes must be created by combining one or more paths.

**There are 3 functions that draw rectangles in `<canvas>`:

> 1. `fillRect(x, y, width, height)` - Draws a filled rectangle.
> 1. `strokeRect(x, y, width, height)` - Draws a rectangular outline.
> 1. `clearRect(x, y, width, height)` - Clears rectangular area making it transparent.
