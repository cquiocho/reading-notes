## ***My name is Christopher Quiocho (he/him) and I am originally from Honolulu, HI. I have been an Executive Administrator for quite some time, primarily in Finance and Marketing. Prior to that, I was a Talent and Business Development Manager for several years. I had the pleasure of traveling and facilitating continuing education classes and training throughout North America.***

## ***Having gone through Code 101 & 102, I am feeling confident and motivated. I am realizing that Software Development is a great fit for me and is a career that I can see myself succeeding in. I am excited to continue with this new career path and looking forward to this journey with Code Fellows.***
