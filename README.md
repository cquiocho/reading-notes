# I embrace the Growth Mindset.

## I welcome the opportunity to try new things, encountering new challenges and pursuing new goals. It is how I choose to continue to grow professionally and personally, and how I can proceed forward confidently. This is what brought me here to Code Fellows and why I will succeed at becoming a Software Developer.
