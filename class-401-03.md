## Reading and Writing Files in Python

### What is a File?

- Contiguous set of bytes used to store data which are then translated into binary 1 and 0 for computer processing. 
- Comprised of 3 main parts:
  1. **Header** - Metadata about the contents of the file.
  1. **Data** - Contents of the file as written by the creator or editor.
  1. **End of File (EOF)** - Special character that indicates end of file.  

### File Paths

- A string that represents the location of a file.
- Broken up into 3 major parts:
  1. **Folder Path** - The file folder location on the file system where subsequent folders are separated by a forward slash / in Unix or backslash \ in Windows.
  1. **File Name** - The actual name of the file.
  1. **Extension** - The end of the file path pre-pended with a period (.) used to indicate the file type.

### Opening and Closing a File in Python

- To open a file use the built-in function open() - open('dog_breeds.txt')
- To close a file there are 2 ways:
  1. Use the **try-finally block**.
  1. Use the **with** statement.

#### Commonly Used File Option Modes

1. **'r'** - Open for reading (default).
1. **'w'** - Open for writing, truncating (overwriting) the file first.
1. **'rb' or 'wb'** - Open in binary mode (read/write using byte data).


## Python Exceptions: An Introduction

**A Python program terminates as soon as it encounters an error.**

### Exceptions versus Syntax Errors

- **Syntax Errors** - Occur when the parser detects an incorrect statement.
- **Exception Errors** - Occur whenever syntactically correct Python code results in an error. 

### Raising an Exception

- Use **raise** to force an exception to offer clues about what went wrong.

### Assertion Error Exception

- Use **assert** to enable verification if a certain condition is met and force an exception if it isn't. 

### Try and Except Block: Handling Exceptions

- Use **try and except** block to catch and handle exceptions.
- The **try** statement will execute normally if there is no exception. all statements are executed until an exception is encountered.
- The **except** statement will execute in response to any exception in the try statement. Used to catch and handle the exception(s) that are encountered in the try clause.

### The Else Clause & Finally

- Use **else** to instruct program to execute code in the absence of exceptions. Lets you code sections that should run only when no exceptions are encountered in the try clause. 
- Use **finally** to execute sections of code that should always run, with or without any previously encountered exceptions.
