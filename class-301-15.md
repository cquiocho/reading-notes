## Diversity & Inclusion

### Silicon Valley’s gender gap is the result of computer-game marketing 20 years ago

- In 2014, 70% of the employees at the top tech companies in Silicon Valley, such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, were male.
- In technical roles, this phenomenon is even more pronounced.
- By the early 80's over 30% of computer science grads were women but those numbers began dropping in the mid 80's and by 2016 the number was as low as 18%.

**This may have been due to male focused computer marketing campaigns in the 80's & 90's.**


### Why diversity matters to your tech company

- Diverse teams are smarter and more creative.
- Diverse companies perform better.
- Companies are losing out on great talent.
- Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base.
- It’s the right thing to do to prevent social inequality.
