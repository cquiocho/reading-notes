# Operators and Loops

## Comparison Operators : Evaluating Conditions

### Evaluate a situation by comparing one value to another, result will be *true* or *false*.

- '==' - **Is equal to**. Compares two values to see if they are the same.
- '!=' - **Is not equal to**. Compares two values to see if they are not the same.
- '===' - **Strict equal to**. Compares two values to check that both the data type and value are the same.
- '!==' - **Strict not equal to**. Compares two values to check that both the data type and value are not the same.
- '>' - **Greater than**. Checks if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right.
- '<' - **Less than**. Checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right.
- '>=' - **Greater than or equal to**. Checks if the number on the left is greater than or equal to the number on the right.
- '<=' - **Less than or equal to**. Checks if the number on the left is greater than or equal to the number on the right.

## Logical Operators

### Allows you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.

- '&&' - Logical **and**. Tests more than one condition.
- `||` - Logical **or**. Tests at least one condition.
- '!' - Logical **not**.  Takes a single Boolean value and inverts it.

## Loops

### Will continuously check a condition until it returns false. There are three common types of loops:

1. **For** - Code will run for a specific number of times, usually set as a counter.
    - *Initialization* - Create a variable and set to 0.
    - *Condition* - Will run until the counter reaches a specific number.
    - *Update* - Each time the loop runs will add one to the counter.
1. **While** - Code will run for as long as the condition is true.
1. **Do While** - Code will continue to run even if the condition evaluates as false.
