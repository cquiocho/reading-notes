## Tables

*Tables present information in a grid format. Contents are written row by row in HTML*

### Basic Table Structure

- `<table></table>` - Element used to create a table.
- `<tr></tr>` - Table row. Indicates the start of each row.
- `<td></td>` - Table data. Indicates each cell of a table.
- `<th></th>` - Table header. Indicates header for column or row, similar to `<td>`.

### Spanning Columns or Rows

*The following are used attributes used with `<th>` and `<td>` elements.*

- > **colspan** - Attribute used to indicate how many columns the cell data will need. 

> `<td colspan="3">Table Data</td>`

- > **rowspan** - Attribute used to indicate how many rows a the cell data will need. 

> `<th rowspan="2">Table Header</th>`

*The following elements help distinguish the table's  **main content** from the **first** and **last** rows of the table.*

*These elements also help with **screen readers** and **styling**.*

- > `<thead></thead>` - Heading of the table.
- > `<tbody></tbody>` - Body content is within this element.
- > `<tfoot></tfoot>` - Footer of the table.

## Constructor Functions

> Used to create multiple objects within the same page by contructing a template for the objects.

<a href="images.object-constructor">Object Constructor</a>

- *An object constructor is essentially a function that creates a template for creating several new objects.*

- *Object contructors are condensed in comaparison to literal notation.*

- *Constructors are comprised of:*
    - Instances (identified as properties in literal notation).
    - Prototypes (identified as methods in literal notation).

**Contextual "this." is the keyword used to identify a key within the object.**

### Constructor Ordering

*JavaScript reads the `<script>` from top to bottom. Due to this, the **ordering** of information and data input is very important.*

  1. Global Variables
  1. Object Constructor
      - Instances
      - Prototypes
          - Functions
          - Loops
  1. Invoke Executable Functions

## Domain Modeling

*Domain modeling creates a model in code to address a specific problem.*

- This model provides the various entities, attributes and behaviors and contraints that are related to the specific problem.

- **Object-Oriented Model** - an entity comprised of methods and properties that store data.
