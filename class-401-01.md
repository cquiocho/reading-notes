## A Beginner's Guide to Big O Notation

- Used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.

- Specifically describes the worst-case scenario, particularly required execution time required or amount of memory or disk space used. 

1. O(1) - Describes an algorithm that always executes in the same time or space regardless of the size of the input data set.
1. O(N) - Describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. Big O notation will always assume the upper limite where the algorithm will prform the maximum number of iterations.
1. O(N2) - Represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. Commonly seen with algorithms that involve nested iterations over the data set.
1. O(2N) - Denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each additon to the input data set. 

## Facts and Myths about Python Names and Values

- Python is a very simple language with simple mechanisms.

- Names refer to values. 
  - *x = 23*
  - *print(x)*    
- Many names can refer to one value.
  - *x = 23*
  - *y = x*
- Names are reassigned independently.
  - *x = 23*
  - *y = x*
  - *x = 12*
- Values live until no references exist.
  - *x = "hello"*
  - *x = "world"*
- Assignment never copies data.
  - *nums = [1, 2, 3]*
  - *other = nums*
- Changes are visible through all names.
  - *nums = [1, 2, 3]*
  - *other = nums*
  - *nums.append(4)*

- Immutable Types: ints, floats, strings, tuples.
  - Immutable values cannot change.

- References can be more than just names.
  - *nums = [1, 2, 3]*
  - *x = nums[1]*

- Examples of types of references:
  - Object attributes.
  - List elements.
  - Dictionary values.
  - Keys.
  - Anything on left side of an assignment.

- Any **name** can be any **value** at any time.
  - *x = 12*
  - *x = "hello"*
  - *x = [1, 2, 3]*
  - *x[1] = "two"*

- Names have no type.
- Values have no scope.
