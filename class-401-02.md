## In Tests We Trust â€” TDD with Python

### Unit tests and TDD?

- **Unit tests** are pieces of code to excerise the input, output and behaviour of your code. 
- **Test-Driven Development** is a strategy to think about tests first.

- The **test name** should be descriptive and explicit on what will be tested. 
- Test name should follow the same name of the module name. 

### AAA: Arrange, Act and Assert

- **Arrange** - You need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input).
- **Act** - Here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour).
- **Assert** - After executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting.

### The Cycle 

**The TDD cycle is made by three steps:**

1. Write a unit test and make it fail.
1. Write the feature and make the test pass.
1. Refactor the code.


## Recursion

### What is Recursion?

- **The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly.**
- The corresponding function containing a recucrsion is called a recursive function.
