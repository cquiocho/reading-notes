## The Call Stack

**A single-threaded interpreter (similar to the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser):**

- Defines function hierarchy and execution order in the JavaScript engine.
- Keeps track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions.
    - What function is being run and what functions are called within that function, etc. 
- The call stack is **synchronus** - executes functions **one at a time** and from **top to bottom**
- Uses the **last in, first out** principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation.

1. Function called, is added to the call stack and will begin to run.
1. Any function within that called function are added "up" on the call stack and will run when invoked.
1. When the function is completed, it is removed from the stack and will resume where it left off.
1. If the stack takes up more space than assigned, it results in a *stack overflow* error.


## JavaScript Error Messages & Debugging

### Types of Error Message:

- **Reference Errors** - Attempting to use a variable that has not been declared.
- **Styntax Errors** - Solved by finding the error and fixing the sytax.
- **Range Errors** - Manipulating the length of an object and giving it an invalid length. 
- **Type Errors** - Attempting to use or access types of data (number, string, boolean, etc.) that are incompatible. 

### Debugging:

- **console.log** - Easiest and most common way to check variables in question.
- **Chrome Developer Tools** - Open in window, click the line in question and proceed with debugging.
- **Debugger** - Create a breakpoint to try and evaluate what happened before and after the error.
- **Call Stack** - Evaluate the call stack to determine what specific function was running when the error occurred.
- **Try...Catch** - Used to encapsulate the problematic function code.
