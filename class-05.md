## Images

### Adding Images

- To add an image, you must use an `<img>` element and must have the following attributes:
  - **src** - This is where you find the image. It can be an absolute URL or relative URL.
  - **alt** - This provides a text description of the image.
  - **title** - Provides additional information of the image.

### Height and Width of Images

- It is very common to see an `<img>` element use the following attributes:
  - **height** - Specifies height of the image in pixels.
  - **width** - Specifies width of the image in pixels.

### Position of Images

- Where an image is placed in the code will affect where it is displayed.
  - Before a paragraph `<img><p>`.
  - Inside the start of a paragraph `<p><img>`.
  - Middle of a paragraph `<p><img></p>`.

### Rules for Creating Images

1. Save images in the right format.
  - Websites mainly use jpeg, gif or png format.
1. Save images at the right size.
  - Save in the same width and height as it will appear on the website.
1. Measure images in pixels.
  - Images dispalyed on screens are in pixels. Measure in pixels and not in centimeters or inches.

- *JPEG* - Preferred format when there are many colors in a picture.
- *GIF or PNG* - Preferred format for images with few colors. 

**Avoid cropping images. Best to source images that are the correct shape and size**

### Transparency

**Partially transparent images requires using one of two formats:**
  
  1. *Transparent GIF* - Straight edges and is 100% transparent.
  1. *Transparent PNG* - Diagonal or rounded edges, semi-opaque or drop shadow.

- **Hue** is the visual appearance of the color
- **Saturation** is the amount of gray in a color. Maximum saturation would have no gray.
- **Brightness** is the amount of black in a color. Maximum brightness would have no black. 

### **The contrast between text color and background color is extremely important**

- **Low Contrast** – Text is harder to read when there is low contrast between text and background.
- **High Contrast** – Text is easier to read when there is high contrast between text and background.
- **Medium Contrast** – For long spans of text, reducing contrast improves readability.
