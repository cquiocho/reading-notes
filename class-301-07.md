### What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

*Teams are now the **fundamental** unit of organization within companies, conglomerates, government agencies and schools.*

**People working in teams achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction.**

*Groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems*

**If a company wants to outstrip its competitors, it needs to influence not only how people work but also *how they work together***

*The most productive employees tend to build larger networks by rotating dining companions.*

**The best managers have good communication and avoid micromanaging.**

 In 2012, Google embarked on an initiative code-named *Project Aristotle* to study hundreds of thier teams...

 ...after more than a year, *Project Aristotle* concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving teams.

 > **Norms** - Traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern howe we function when we gather.

 **Two behaviors that successful teams exhibit are:**

1. Equality in distributon of conversational turn-taking - having members speak in roughly the same proportion.

1. High *average social sensitivity* - skilled at being intuitive about how others felt based on **tone of voice**, **expressions** and **non-verbal cues**.

*These two behaviors are aspects known as **psychological safety** - defined as a shared belief that members of a team are safe for interpersonal risk-taking.*

*A sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up.*

*It is an environment characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect, where people are comfortable being themselves.*

### Psychological Safety and Emotional Conversations are critical to making a team work.

*No one wants to put on a **work face** or leave part of their personality and inner life at home.*

**In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.**

*Success is often built on experiences - like emotional interactionsand complicated conversations and discussions of who we want to be and how we make each other feel.*

  - Web services that conform to REST can operate between many computer systems on the internet.

Systems that use REST have fast performance and reliability.
