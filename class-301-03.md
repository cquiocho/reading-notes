## JavaScript Templating

- Templating is a fast and efficient technique to create JavaScript templates using a JSON data source. 

- The template is HTML markup with tags that will insert variables of run programming logic. 

- The template engine replaces declared variables and instances with actual values and converts the template into an HTML file.

- Mustache is template syntax used for HTML, config fules, source code, etc. Expands tags and uses values provided in hash or object.

- Referred as "logic-less" because there are no:
  - "if" statements
  - "else" clauses
  - "for" loops

- Only uses tags replaced with:
  - values
  - sometimes nothing
  - series of values

    - row-reverse - right to left.
    - column - top to bottom.

    - nowrap - (default) all on one line.
    - wrap - wrap onto multiple lines from top to bottom.
    - wrap-reverse - wrap onto multiple lines from botton to top.

    - flex-start - (default) items are packed toward the start.
    - flex-end - items are packed toward the end.
    - left - items packed toward left edge of container.
    - right - items packed toward right edge of container.
    - center - items are centered.
    - space-between - evenly distributed in the line.
    - space-around - evenly distributed with equal space around them.
    - space-evenly - distributed so spacing between items are equal.

- **align-items** - Defines the behvior of how items are laid out.
    - stretch - (default) stretch to fill the container.
    - flex-start - placed at the start of the cross axis.
    - flex-end - placed at the end of the cross axis.

> Properties for the **Children** (flex items):

- **order** - Controls the order of appearance within a container.
- **flex-grow** - Defines ability for an item to grow if necessary. Dictates how much space an item should take up.
- **flex-shrink** - Defines ability for a flex item to shrink if needed.
- **flex-basis** - Defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed.
